Compile for application is very simple, either enter "make" to compile both awget.c and ss.c or enter "make awget" or "make ss" to compile specific apps.

Make will default compile to objects named "awget" and "ss" respectively.

To run:

    Stepping Stones
        A) Must specify port using flat (e.g. ./ss -p 8888).
        B) Port range is not limited, so please have respect for other services running on test servers.
        C) Will continue listening until you break the process <Ctrl+C>.  This would be handy if we wanted to create an autonymous system that others could use.

    Anonymous-Web Get
        A) Must specify target URL in good form (e.g. http://...).
        B) If no chainfile is provided, will use default chainfile named chaingang.txt.
        C) If you pass a "-c" flag with no filename it will abort.
        D) Usage format is ./awget <URL> [-c chainfilename.txt].

    Chainfile
        A) Chainfile must specify the number of stepping stones.
        B) Chainfile must have stone tuples in proper format (e.g. <IP ADDRESS> <PORT NUM>).
